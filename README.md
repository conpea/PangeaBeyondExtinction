# ProjectPangea

Developed with Unreal Engine 5.0.0

Rules for using this Repo: 

1. (Programmers only) Make your own Branch (Dev-Name-Branch), this will be where all of your prototype work goes.

2. (Artists) Make your own Branch (Art-Name-Branch), this will be where all of your assets and testing goes.

3. Do NOT work on any scene/script that another programmer has open, nor use scenes from other artists this is best avoided by using your own Branch and a sublevel in unreal.

4. Merges with Master will be done after approval from department leads.

5. Fetch before opening UE5 every time, even fetch several times to be sure.
